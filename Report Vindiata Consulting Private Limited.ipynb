    "Reward for Consistency/Streaks: Introduce bonus points for consistent daily logins, weekly game streaks, or continuous engagement over a period. This fosters routine usage of the platform.\n",

For example, a deposit of $10,000 might yield slightly more than proportional points compared to ten $1,000 deposits, encouraging higher value transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incentivize Referrals: If player acquisition is a goal, award loyalty points for successfully referring new users who become active players.\n",
